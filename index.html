                <p>Hello beautiful people, my name is Paola. First and foremost I would like to share the fact
                    that I have two fur babies (a poodle and a shih tzu), but it doesn't stop there, I have about
                    a dozen fur nieces and nephews. I know what you must be thinking, "She's obviously a die
                    hard dog person", WRONG, I also love cats. Anyways, besides throwing all my love at
                    domesticated animals, I like to blow off some steam by working out and roller blading.
                    My favorite meal of the day is breakfast, which might explain my unhealthy obsession with
                    the double edged sword that is sunday brunch. My favorite holiday is Thanksgiving, because food?
                </p>
               
                <p> I'm Venezuelan, so I'm just going to come out and say that Venezuelan empanadas are superior, I
                    am willing to defend my claim.
                    I enjoy space documentaries, nutella flavored anything, and Epcot (again, because food?). If you
                    made it this far,
                    then many thanks. This was my "about me", hope you liked it.
                </p>
